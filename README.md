This is a simple example showing how to use Fauna using FQL within a Next.js app. To use it, you'll need to provide a `FAUNADB_SECRET` value in a `.env` file containing a key for your Fauna account. Within Fauna, you'll need a `shows` collection that contains data with a `title` field (string) and `watched` field (boolean).
